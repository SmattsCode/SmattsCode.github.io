# Welcome to Smatt's Code

Hi I'm Smatt. I'm a firm believer of not reinventing the wheel unless there is a real need for it.  So the reason behind this website is to share my adventures, successful or not. Helping you to avoid the pitfalls (I will undoubtably fall in!) and sharing the shortcuts I (hopefully) find that can benefit _your_ projects.  And have a laugh along the way...

## Enjoy My Latest Posts...
