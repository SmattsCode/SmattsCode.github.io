Dear Reader,

Thank you for using your precious time to browse my little corner of the web.  I know in this fast paced world we all lead full, busy lives and we all want good answers to our questions and we want them quickly.  As such I would like to start my blog by being as honest and upfront as I can...

I have a full time job and I'm married with 3 daughters who keep me busy, VERY BUSY!  So the updates may not be as often or as regular as I want.  I will do my best to provide useful and meaningful articles as often as I can.

Going back to the part about needing answers quickly, I also want to set out a list of things I will try to stick to.  A sort of mini manifesto if you will...

- Articles written to solve a specific problem will have the answers as close to the start of the post as possible.
- Keep answers clear and concise
- Explanations will come AFTER I have given the answer rather than needing to scroll down and wade through long explanations before you get to the bits you _need_.
- Explain the answers clearly and in as much depth as I can WITHOUT getting too technical (and becoming a cure for insomnia!)
- Use graphics whenever it helps

I make these promises to you because that's what I want from a blog.  Good concise answers when I'm in a rush but also clear explanations so that I can spend the time to understand the reason behind the answer when I have the time.

I hope I stick to this mini manifesto and that you hold me to it... if that's what you want?  Let me know...
